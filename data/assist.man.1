.SH DESCRIPTION
assist implements the algorithm to create schedules that put the MXGS and MMIA
instruments of ASIM in a correct configuration for ISS eclipses and SAA crossing.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-base-time\  DATETIME
Start the schedule with the first eclipse starting after the given DATETIME
(RFC3339 format)
.TP
.BI \-alliop\  FILE
Save schedule to FILE
.TP
.BI \-instrlist\  FILE
Save instrument list to FILE
.TP
.BI \-config
Use a configuration file to set various parameters
.TP
.B \-list
Print the list of blocks that will be schedule from the trajectory
.TP
.B \-list-periods
Print the list of eclipses and SAA from the trajectory
.TP
.B \-ignore
When using list, ignore constraints set to ROCON/ROCOFF
.TP
.B \-keep-comment
Write comments from the commands file into the schedule file. Setting this flag
to true force also assist to add its own comments.
.TP
.BI \-resolution\  TIME
Interval of TIME between two rows in the trajectory file
.TP
.B \-version
Print version and exit
.TP
.B \-help
Print a help message and exit
.

.TP
.BI \-rocoff-time\  TIME
ROCOFF expected execution time
.TP
.BI \-rocon-wait\  TIME
wait TIME after entering eclipse before scheduling ROCON
.TP
.BI \-roc-margin\  TIME

.TP
.BI \-azm\  TIME
Expected on-board AZM dururation
.TP
.BI \-saa\  TIME
SAA duration to resolve conflict between ROCON and ROCOFF
.
.SH CER OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-cer-time\  TIME
TIME before entering eclipse to switch CERON/CEROFF
.TP
.BI \-cer-crossing\  TIME
Minimum crossing TIME of SAA and eclipse to switch CERON
.TP
.BI \-cer-before\  TIME
Schedule CERON TIME before SAA enter during eclipse
.TP
.BI \-cer-after\  TIME
Schedule CEROFF TIME before SAA exit during eclipse
.TP
.BI \-cer-before-roc\  TIME
Delay CERON before when conflict with ROCON/ROCOFF
.TP
.BI \-cer-after-roc\  TIME
Delay CEROFF before when conflict with ROCON/ROCOFF
.TP
.BI \-ceron-file\  FILE
Use FILE with commands for CERON
